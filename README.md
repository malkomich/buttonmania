Puzzle game whose objective is to get all the square values to 0.

Each time you press a square, all the squares next to it will reduce its value in 1, or reset to 3 if the value was already 0.

The execution is through a terminal, and you need PyGTK for the graphic interface. You can get it in [GNOME libraries](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/), choosing the release which fits your python installation.
